In addition to the standard advantages of living in an apartment building, access to the premises by car is restricted to the owner or tenant of the apartment, no one else can pass through the barrier. The location is on the outskirts of the Z\u00e1vodie district, in \u017dilina, which is a very popular address. Z\u00e1vodie is one of the original parts of the city of \u017dilina, making it within walking distance to the city center. Z\u00e1vodie offers residents complete civic amenities: a school, a kindergarten, a football field, grocery stores, and a veterinarian, all within walking distance. Also a popular relaxation spot by the Raj\u010danka, or a small mountain hike to H\u00e1jik, or Hradisko. The public transport stop is right next to the apartment building. Parking is provided by underground garages and designated parking spaces in front of the apartment building. And how do you perceive the apartment upon your first visit ? Here is a detailed description from the first viewing. Directly behind the ramp, which can only be accessed by the apartment owners, I found hassle-free parking. One parking space in front of the apartment is always exclusively yours. If that\u2019s not enough, we also have the largest garage, but that would be available for an additional fee if you are interested. Entering from the parking lot via the walkway, you will take a few steps down the hallway to the entrance of the apartment building, and from the hallway to your apartment, resembling an entry from the yard into the foyer of a family home. Just like the family house, this one is located on the ground floor, but not at ground level, underneath it is a heated parking space in the garage. The entrance to the apartment is directly behind the security, soundproof, and fire-resistant doors. Above the apartment, there is only one neighbor left. From the enclosed entrance hallway, you enter directly into the living area, which features a practically furnished kitchen with a U-shaped kitchen unit equipped with appliances: oven, glass-ceramic electric hob, dishwasher, and refrigerator with freezer - the latter is located in a large masonry pantry. The large open space of the living area is completely cleared, but the good news is that the price of the apartment includes a visualization of the interior design, along with all the materials from the architect, including options for customization. Photos can be found below the text. In this space where the family gathers, measuring 28.88 m2, you will find ample room for a dining area as well as a living room, and additionally, there is a built-in space for a wardrobe and a brick pantry. From the living room, you will pass through the hallway to the bathroom, which has an area of 5.31 m2 and includes: a shower enclosure, a full-sized bathtub, a sink with a mirror, and an electric towel dryer on the wall, with additional space remaining for a washing machine or dryer. A few steps down the hallway, just around the corner, there is another restroom, however, that room could be utilized in multiple ways. Wardrobe, separate shower enclosure, sauna. From the hallway, there are two more doors leading to the rooms in the night section of the apartment, which serve the residents as a bedroom or children's room, and are equipped with built-in wardrobes. The rooms have an area of 15.38 and 15.93 m2. The view from them immediately brought me the necessary relaxation and created a feeling of living in nature, just look at the photos, there is greenery all around. The orientation of the apartment from these two rooms in the night area is southeast, making it an ideal solution, as the morning sun and the singing of birds will wake you up. The living area of the apartment is west-facing, which allows for afternoon sunlight in the dining room and living room. Ideal for a pleasant gathering with family. The apartment's area includes a corresponding cellar with an area of 2.4 m2. The apartment has undergone servicing prior to sale preparation, so aside from moving in, you won't have to deal with anything else. Financing the purchase of the apartment is possible up to 100% of the purchase price through a mortgage. The mortgage interest rate starts at 3.95% with a fixed term of 3 or 4 years.\"}", "usedPromptTokens": 940, "usedCompletionTokens": 938, "totalUsedTokens": 1878}, {"response": "{\"error\": \"Invalid
