If you are looking for a spacious old-town apartment that can be moved into immediately, located on a great address right in the center of \u017dilina, this offer is perfect for you! In 2018, the apartment underwent a complete extensive reconstruction - water, waste, and electrical systems were replaced, plastic windows with triple glazing were installed, a new bathroom with sanitary ware was created, and the floors, walls, and entire furnishings were updated. The beautiful apartment is excellently designed in terms of layout - upon entering through the high-quality security door, you have ample space in the hallway for shoes and coats. On the left side, there is a bathroom with a bathtub and toilet, along with a great bonus of this apartment - a pantry, which is also equipped with water and drainage for the placement of a washing machine. Around the tastefully placed bookshelf, you will reach the kitchen featuring a new kitchen unit with built-in appliances (dishwasher, oven, glass-ceramic hob, extractor hood) . The right part of the apartment features a spacious living room (20 m\u00b2), which can also accommodate a dining table. From the living room, you can access the bedroom (14 m\u00b2) with a double bed and a wardrobe. The apartment also includes a spacious cellar (7 m\u00b2) . The apartment is located on the ground floor of the brick residential building without an elevator. The building was built in such a way that it offers residents greenery and a relaxation area in its courtyard. A complete revitalization is planned in the near future. The entrance doors with an electronic intercom and the windows in the common areas have been replaced. The location where you can live is truly excellent - right behind the apartment building, you will find a beautiful park with a playground and a cozy caf\u00e9, or you can simply relax by the fountain in the shade of the trees.\" }", "usedPromptTokens": 555, "usedCompletionTokens": 435, "totalUsedTokens": 990}, {"response": "{\n  \"name\": \"John Doe\",\n  \"age\": 35,\n  \"address\": {\n
