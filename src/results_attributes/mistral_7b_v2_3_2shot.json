For sale is a 3-room apartment in a brick building after reconstruction. The apartment is located on the first floor of the two-floor building with one entrance and six apartments. The total floor area of the apartment is 56 m2, the cellar has an area of approximately 5 m2, there is also a laundry room available, and an interesting feature is the civil defense shelter, which has electricity and water (potential use for a workshop or something similar) . The apartment consists of an entrance hallway, from which you enter the kitchen, the living room, and the bathroom with a toilet. The kitchen is visually divided by a counter into a section with the kitchen unit and a dining area. There are three windows - in the area with the kitchen unit - facing north-northeast, in the dining area there are two windows - one facing northeast, the other facing east. You can enter the bedroom from the kitchen. The bedroom has a French window facing west, and the living room also has a window oriented to the west. The living room also leads to the bedroom (through room) . The floors in the apartment are laminate, and there is tile in the hallway. The bathroom with a toilet features a washing machine, a bathtub, and an Immergas gas boiler. A major advantage is the window. Heating is independent - with a gas boiler. The apartment underwent reconstruction in 2009, during which the electrical installations were replaced, new plastering was done, floors were installed, and a brick core was created. The windows are plastic with blinds, and the doors and frames are original. The apartment building is managed by Bytterm. Monthly costs are set for three people. They consist of an amount of 35 \u20ac for electricity, an amount of 70 \u20ac is an advance for gas consumption (the overpayment is usually 250 \u20ac), and an amount of 90 \u20ac for 3 people is for Bytterm (the prescription per person is 55 \u20ac) . It is possible to reduce monthly costs by saving on electricity consumption (there is a small child in the apartment, so the consumption is higher due to the washing machine) and by lowering the temperature in the apartment, as the heating is independent. The apartment is located in a prestigious part of the city - everything is within walking distance. Parking is directly by the apartment building (annual resident card costs 50 \u20ac per car) . The price of this interesting property is 134000 \u20ac. The apartment is available upon agreement. Financing is also possible through a mortgage loan. Consultation is included in the price."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{ \"attributes\": [\"rooms\", \"flatArea\", \"floor\", \"hasSeparateToilet\", \"totalFloors\", \"price\", \"cellarArea\", \"hasParking\", \"flatModificationYear\", \"hasCellar\"] }"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Input: RESERVED!
