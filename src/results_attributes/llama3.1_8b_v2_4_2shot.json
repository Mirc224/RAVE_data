APARTMENT BUILDING : The apartment building has only 5 apartments, consists of 3 storeys , and the attic apartment is the only one on the top floor, which is an advantage for privacy. The apartment building is insulated on three sides, and one side is not yet insulated. The entrance doors are already new plastic ones, complete with mailboxes. After the attic reconstruction, it would be ideal to discuss with the manager the reconstruction of the entrance interior (plastering, flooring, painting), or possibly to carry out this reconstruction as compensation for the allocation of the remaining spaces in the attic. Attic apartment : The apartment is in its original condition, located on the 2nd floor with a southern orientation (towards Holiday Inn) . The building has only two floors and is without an elevator, which is not necessary given the height of the storey. The total area according to the title deed is 81.70 m2, of which the area of the attic apartment is 65.87 m2 and the large cellar is 15.83 m2, located on the ground floor of the adjacent building right across from the apartment block. Right next to the entrance of the attic apartment, there is another attic space with an area of 18.70 m2, which is currently used by the owner (there is a possibility to legally settle and enlarge the apartment by this area or to use it as a storage room or for anything else). Opposite, there is another attic space with an area of 18.70 m2. Utilities : In the entrance on the ground floor, a new electrical cabinet has already been installed with pre-installation for 2 electricity meters. The owners financed the construction of a new connection from the PRIS cabinet from the street, extended to the mentioned entrance on the ground floor, and from there, electrical cables were run up to the 1st floor. The electrical wiring has been designed for heating with an electric boiler and radiators. Water and sewage pipes have also been extended to the 1st floor. There is no gas in the apartment building, but a chimney is available for connecting a fireplace stove. Location and surroundings : Right next to the apartment building, there is a small park (30 m), as well as a playground a short distance away with climbing frames, swings, a ping pong table, and more.

Usage: After renovating the apartment, it will be ideal for short-term rentals as it is located in an attractive area near the football and ice hockey stadium, and also opposite the Holiday Inn. Advantage: Unlike other attics and lofts, this space is registered as an apartment on the title deed and not as a non-residential space (therefore, no occupancy permit is required) . Ideal for renting, whether long-term or short-term (AirBNB), as it is located in an attractive area near the football and winter stadium and just a short distance from the city center.

APARTMENT BUILDING : The apartment building has only 5 apartments, consists of 3 storeys , and the attic apartment is the only one on the top floor, which is an advantage for privacy. The apartment building is insulated on three sides, and one side is not yet insulated. The entrance doors are already new plastic ones, complete with mailboxes. After the attic reconstruction, it would be ideal to discuss with the manager the reconstruction of the entrance interior (plastering, flooring, painting), or possibly to carry out this reconstruction as compensation for the allocation of the remaining spaces in the attic. Attic apartment : The apartment is in its original condition, located on the 2nd floor with a southern orientation (towards Holiday Inn) . The building has only two floors and is without an elevator, which is not necessary given the height of the storey. The total area according to the title deed is 81.70 m2, of which the area of the attic apartment is 65.87 m2 and the large cellar is 15.83 m2, located on the ground floor of the adjacent building right across from the apartment block. Right next to the entrance of the attic apartment, there is another attic space with an area of 18.70 m2, which is currently used by the owner (there is a possibility to legally settle and enlarge the apartment by this area or to use it as a storage room or for anything else). Opposite, there is another attic space with an area of 18.70 m2. Utilities : In the entrance on the ground floor, a new electrical cabinet has already been installed with pre-installation for 2 electricity meters. The owners financed the construction of a new connection from the PRIS cabinet from the street, extended to the mentioned entrance on the ground floor, and from there, electrical cables were run up to the 1st floor. The electrical wiring has been designed for heating with an electric boiler and radiators. Water and sewage pipes have also been extended to the 1st floor. There is no gas in the apartment building, but a chimney is available for connecting a fireplace stove. Location and surroundings : Right next to the apartment building, there is a small park (30 m), as well as a playground a short distance away with climbing frames, swings, a ping pong table, and more. Across the road, you will find the Holiday Inn hotel, Lidl (140 m), Pharmacy (80 m), ice rink (150 m), and football stadium (200 m) . The area offers complete civic amenities and the entire region is undergoing revitalization. Parking is available on the street. Usage: After renovating the apartment, it will be ideal for short-term rentals as it is located in an attractive area near the football and ice hockey stadium, and also opposite the Holiday Inn. Advantage: Unlike other attics and lofts, this space is registered as an apartment on the title deed and not as a non-residential space (therefore, no occupancy permit is required) . Ideal for renting, whether long-term or short-term (AirBNB), as it is located in an attractive area near the football and winter stadium and just a short distance from the city center. After purchasing the side spaces, there is also the possibility of dividing and creating two residential units.
