The living area of the apartment, the living room with kitchen, is bathed in the warm glow of the western sun, providing a cozy feeling throughout the afternoon. In addition, as seen in the photos, the owners have enlarged the entrance to the kitchen, which has increased the overall space and makes it feel more open and airy compared to the traditional layout of 3-room apartments in H\u00e1jik. Two rooms, which are mostly used as a children's room or as a guest room and bedroom, are oriented to the east. On the eastern side of this street, there is also an access road and parking for cars. The apartment underwent a complete reconstruction 5 years ago and is tastefully furnished with built-in wardrobes, leaving plenty of free floor space for use. The entrance is completely reconstructed and maintained, including the insulation of the basements, bicycle storage, stroller storage, and common areas, which are also heated in winter. The apartment is on the first, elevated floor, so children can play under the windows on the renovated sidewalk without car access, and you can keep them within reach. In addition to being a quiet, car-free street on the west side, it features a nicely furnished, renovated playground and access to meadows and fields, which will be especially appreciated by dog owners. The second playground is located 50 meters from the apartment on the eastern side, in the courtyard. In addition, there is a kindergarten right next to the apartment building (100 m), followed by an elementary school (250 m), and a little further away, 300 meters, is a shopping center with various shops, a post office, and a fitness center. Shopping enthusiasts have access to Tesco and COOP Jednota approximately 350 m from the apartment. The bus stop is a 2-minute walk away, and buses number 6, 16, and 27 frequently take you to the city. Housing costs amount to 180 \u20ac for utilities, and 45 \u20ac for electricity and gas combined. The apartment is home to a family of three. The property will be available for move-in from July 2024. Note for homemakers: The kitchen set is from DECODOM, it is still current, and you can purchase cabinets up to the ceiling if needed. The owners thought of everything, which is why the oven can be placed elsewhere as well. Quality security doors will ensure your sense of safety. A large living room sofa can remain in the apartment by agreement for an additional fee.
